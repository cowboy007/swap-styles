# Swap Styles
A little plugin for swaping styles between 2 layers in Sketch. Don't ```⌘⌥C```/```⌘⌥V``` endlessly, just ```⌘^S``` (cmd + ctrl + S).

## How to Install
1. Download and open ```swap-styles-master.zip```
2. Open ```Swap Styles.sketchplugin``` (Sketch will automatically install the plugin)

## Notes
* Tested on Sketch 3.3.2
* Works only on shape layer and swaps only fills and borders. Shadows and text styles support is coming up!
